## My process

### Built with

- `create-react-app`
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For utility classes

### What I learned

Here is a list of things I learned from making this project.

- **React** Keep your assets in public folder ensures you can access it anywhere in the project. By giving `/path_to_image` it has no need for any path traversal `'../../'`.
- **CSS** Best practice for buttons is to add padding rather than height.
- **CSS** I'm not ashamed to admit even as a dev for 6 plus years I still needed a refresher on best practice for margin vs padding ðŸ˜….
- **git** Github will not count commit contributions from your machine unless `git config --global user.email` is set to your Github account email.
- **Other** Variable fonts are coollll.

### Continued development

#### CSS Refactor

I could refactor a lot. My approach from the beginning was to utilize CSS variables / tokens and even though I knew I was going to add in `tailwind`. I probably should have added in tailwind first, modified the config file to fit my use cases, then added in custom tokens and classes if needed.

### Useful resources
